Saber Factory can load custom sabers as well (.saber files).

But since you cannot load bundles twice and Custom Saber doesn't unload bundles right away
you have to keep these things in mind.

1. If you want Saber Factory to load sabers from the "CustomSabers" folder  
   in the root directory of Beat Saber, then you have to load Beat Saber without Custom Saber installed  
   (rename CustomSaber.dll to CustomSaber.dll.bak)  
2. If you want to load .saber files and have Custom Saber installed at the same time,  
   then Saber Factory can also load any saber from the "Beat Saber/UserData/SaberFactory/Parts" directory (and any sub directory with .saber files in it).  
   Just make sure that the sabers in the Parts folder aren't present in the CustomSabers folder.
   
   To select a custom saber in-game, go into Saber Factory, click the most right button on the top navbar and select a saber.
   
   To create a saber with Saber Factory again, click the blade button on the top navbar and select a blade from there.
   
   **If you are the creator of a saber and want it to be allowed for customization in Saber Factory let me know on discord (Toni Macaroni#8970)**
