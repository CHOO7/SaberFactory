## What is Saber Factory?
Create your own sabers in-game

Instead of downloading the whole saber, you download parts and combine them like lego pieces.  
Everything is built around customization.  
Change the shape, shaders, material properties, textures and more of the parts.

*This mod doesn't have anything to do with the Custom Sabers mod*   
*If you want to create your own parts refer to the "How do I create parts" note*   
*You can still install both mods and toggle Saber Factory in the settings to use Custom Sabers*

## How do I install it
1) Download the "SaberFactory.zip" [Here](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/SaberFactory/releases)
2) Unpack it in your Beat Saber directory

## How do I use custom sabers
You can find the guide [here](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/SaberFactory/blob/master/CustomSabersTutorial.md)

## How do I create parts?
You can find guides on the discord server

## Why is the mod obfuscated and the source not available?
I'm not only trying to make the mod as pleasant as possible for users,  
but also for 3D Artists and since I was told that asset theft is a big issue  
I implemented a package encryption. But for this to work I have to make  
it a bit more difficult reverse engineer the encryption than just downloading the source  
and compiling it.

But if you have any questions about the inner workings of the mod I will be happy enough to answer them.
